//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['No Way Home', 'Us', 'Dark Knight']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = movies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrLength = movies.length
console.log(arrLength)

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. 
// What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? 
// Would your solution still work?
let lastElement = movies[2]

OR 

// let lastElement = movies[movies.length - 1]
